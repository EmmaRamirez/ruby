# Practice Ruby Code

This is a repository of Ruby code that I've written to practice my Ruby skills. I've tried to comment my code as much as possible to explain what it does.

In order to run any of these, just open up your Ruby Interpreter and run the following command from the correct directory:

```
$ ruby [filename].rb
```

Below is a list of each file, the filepath, and what they involve, as well as the date added:

Print Name | print_name.rb | Puts using input
