# Practice Ruby Code

This is a repository of Ruby code that I've written to practice my Ruby skills. I've tried to comment my code as much as possible to explain what it does.

In order to run any of these, just open up your Ruby Interpreter and run the following command from the correct directory:

```
$ ruby [filename].rb
```

Below is a list of each file, the filepath, and what they involve, as well as the date added:

Filename | Filepath | Involves
Hello World | hello_world.rb | Basic
Print Name | print_name.rb | Puts using input
Rectangle Measurer | rectangle_measurer.rb | Measures area of rectangle
Theater Admission 1 | theater_admission.rb | Changes price based on user age
Theater Admission 2 | theater_admission_2.rb | Changes price based on user age
Theater Admission 3 | theater_admission_3.rb | Changes price based on user age
Random Number Guess | random_number_guess.rb | Guess a random int game
Case Statement | case_statement.rb | Case statement outline
For Loop 1 | for_loop_1.rb | For loop with array
For Loop 2 | for_loop_2.rb | For loop with hashes
Odd or Even? | determine_odd_or_even.rb | Determines if int is odd or even
Determine Slope & Slope Sign | determine_slope.rb | Determines slope of two arbitrary points and then if that slope is positive, negative, or neither
